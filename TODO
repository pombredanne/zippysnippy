Ideas for txt management suite

might be good if stuff was written to disk more frequently

- deduplication
  - maybe it can run in the background.
  - per-category, or maybe not.
  - low priority in any case.
  - show entries by liklihood of duplication. if user says "not duplicate",
    store that information somewhere. Or maybe algorithm will be good enough?

- split:

- keys:
  - s: split (yes, I like this idea)
        open the edit window, with a notice in comments (like git) to add some kind
        of separator where you want the split to happen.
  - c: categorize/recategorize (pops up menu)
  - ?: help
  - enter: next entry

- clipboard:
  - it's probably possible to get the source application for the selection in the
    X clipboard by going through the C api but its sortof a pain. take a look at
    the xclip source code for examples, if you care enough to

Snippet Manager is a console-based tool designed to store "snippets" of
information that you find useful. After a snippet is stored, Snippet Manager
will present the snippet back to you to read again at gradually increasing
intervals.

My life has been filled with examples of learning something useful and
immediately forgetting all about it. Effective learning requires repetition.

Snippet Manager was motivated by my love for (but irreconcilable differences
with) SuperMemo, a tool for incremental reading and fact memorization.

To be of any use, Snippet Manager must be used _habitually_.

... and is meant to appeal to the unix philosophy of doing one thing well.
